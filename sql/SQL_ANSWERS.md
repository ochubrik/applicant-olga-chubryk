### All the queries have 2 variants: one that uses bigquery-public-data.geo_us_boundaries for enhanced geographic matching, and one that doesn't â€” to account for cities with the same name across different states.

Please find the answers in .csv files. 

### Provide the average daily temperature for each city in each state.

```
SELECT
  oc.city,
  oc.state,
  ROUND(AVG(oc.avg_temp), 2) AS avg_daily_temperature
FROM
  `open-weather-project.weather_data.oc_weather_data_historical` oc
GROUP BY
  oc.city, oc.state
ORDER BY
  oc.state, avg_daily_temperature DESC;
```
